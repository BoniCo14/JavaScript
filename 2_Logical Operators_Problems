Using Math.random() write an expression that has a 30% chance of being true, and a 70% chance of being false.
console.log(Math.random() >= 0.25)

//9
//The following complicated expression will return the number of seconds that have passed since the beginning of 1970:
//(new Date().getTime() / 1000)
//Don't worry about the expression itself, other than the fact that this returns a number.
//A traffic light is green for 20 seconds, yellow for 5 seconds, and red for 40 seconds.
//At the beginning of 1970, it turned green.
//In code.js write some code that uses console.log() and the expression above to describe the color of the traffic light right now.
